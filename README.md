# Distinct-Cognitive-Interventionstions-
Linear Mixed Effects Model (Longitudinal Analysis) 
The following SAS project is a longitudinal analysis on an ACTIVE(Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) dataset based on a controlled trial conducted at six field sites. The trial's primary aim was to test the effects of three distinct cognitive interventions previously found to be successful in improving elders' performance on basic measures of cognition under laboratory or small-scale field conditions on measures of cognitively demanding daily activities. Time was measured/compared from baseline to initial ten training, booster training (to those randomly selected), 1-year evaluation, 2-year evaluation, 3-year evaluation, and 5-year evaluation.  The covariates of interest in evaluating the significance of HVLT (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test) outcome are intervention group, age, gender, months, driving status, MMSE (mini-mental state examination total), site, baseline, and years of education. I hypothesize that there is a difference in pattern change over time for the intervention subject-specific groups by HVLT scores over five years. Which intervention group performed better?
